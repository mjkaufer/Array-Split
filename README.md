#Array-Split-Thing
This is basically the shell of something I plan on creating allowing one to type _**with their minds**_!

##How to Use
There are three keys - **A**, **S**, and **D**. You use them to continuously narrow down the possibilities of selection until you reach one character. Said character is then appended to a `<p>` tag. When you select `alert & clear`, the text in the box is, as the name implies, alerted and then cleared. It's also appended to a list at the bottom. 

##Demo
There should be a working demo at http://mjkaufer.github.com/split

##Notes
We're using flat-ui because it's super cool.

Functionality can be added easily, but this is more of a shell for people (including myself) to mess around with.

Have fun!
